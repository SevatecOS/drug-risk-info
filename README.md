**Significant Considerations**

Under a challenging timeline resulting from the unanticipated inclusion of an unrestricted category for the GSA 18F BPA response, Sevatec rapidly achieved significant outcomes for a compelling and innovative prototype, including:

* One
* Two
* Three

The following narrative documents our agile approach to achieving these objectives, using best practices developed from successful agile implementations across the federal government.

**Understanding of Solicitation**

The General Services Administration’s 18F agile development organization seeks industry partners with expert agile qualifications for agile delivery, consulting services, and peer support to address the biggest technical challenges facing the Federal Government. 18F demonstrates a new approach to building and buying Information Technology that prioritizes public-facing digital services.  Core to its approach, 18F focuses on user needs, quick delivery, working software, meaningful solutions, and transparent practices. 18F seeks partners capable of supporting the growing demand for its services with quality outcomes and consistent practices reflective of the stellar reputation 18F established since inception.

**Our Approach**

Sevatec evangelizes agile development at every opportunity for our Federal customers. We introduced agile practices on our Information Technology Analysis, Software Design, and Development Support Services contract with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). We transformed software development practices at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) by introducing rapid prototyping, user stories, and scrum practices. For the U.S. Customs and Immigrations Service (USCIS), we innovated by providing Agile Analytics, a combination of Scrum, Kanban, and Scrumban teams supported with automation for quality and testing of complex data warehouse and business intelligence solutions.
For the 18F BPA, we applied our experience and practices to showcase both the outcomes and process of our technical and business solutions team. We established an ambitious plan for a fully automated DevOps pipeline, using technologies prioritized by 18F, and leveraging a cloud-based infrastructure from day one. We quickly assembled a team of diverse technical professionals who self-organized around the goal of an always-working, always-evolving prototype supported with automated builds, code inspection, test coverage, packaging, and deployment. Our team then prioritized two goals: (1) develop a meaningful initial design, and (2) implement a working DevOps pipeline. After achieving these two baseline activities, the 18F BPA response simply relied on our iterative, evolving improvement of the product based on feedback from our users; all tracked in our working, automated development infrastructure.

**Our Team**

We assembled a six member team, led by an experienced agile program manager accountable for the ultimate quality of the prototype. The remaining team members blended front-end development, back-end development, technical architecture, and user interface design skills. We then convened a group of mock users to facilitate the normal feedback interactions expected during an agile development engagement.  On short notice, the team members were notified and they immediately self-organized, created a charter, and developed a product description. They evaluated the Agile Delivery Services (ADS I) solicitation, identified core business requirements, and formulated an initial, high-level plan for delivery. Our team avoided rigid scheduling, knowing from experience that the early phases would call for managed chaos as design, development, and DevOps proceeded in parallel, given the short window for delivery.

**Our Solution**

Sevatec quickly established a prototype goal to: (1) demonstrate technical proficiency of both agile development and DevOps, (2) reflect human-centered design and user feedbacks, and (3) prototype a meaningful baseline implementation that always works and meets the needs of our user community. We embraced the objective of providing 18F a working GitHub repository where – during evaluation – your team could introduce a change to the source code and evaluate its impact on our working, public-facing web application with zero manual interaction required.
For the application, our team established a concise vision statement: "Our simplicity-first DrugRisk information search enables non-technical users to retrieve relevant information about the use, risks, and enforcement actions regarding specific drugs."  Based on this vision the team conducted assessments of existing documentation, data sets, API capabilities and limitations, possible shared services, COTS products, Cloud solutions, and other emerging alternatives that could be used for the prototype.  
The team met with the user group to solicit basic needs and requirements and documented the story boards and associated Product Backlog Items (PBIs) using Trello, as indicated in **Figure 1**. This involved the creation of three basic user stories, and approximately 40 PBIs needed to address the base requirements received from the users.  These PBIs were reviewed for priority and effort and aligned to the technical and architectural solutions that best fit the rapid but reusable development releases.

The rapid nature of the prototype required high-level technical architecture documentation for solution patterns, API boundaries, data sources, information exchanges, integration points, services catalogs, performance and volume metrics, and other technical architecture factors. Our DevOps architecture includes for source code, Docker for configuration management, and an AWS EC2 container to support both our Jenkins continuous integration server and our elastic, load-balanced prototype deployment instances, as illustrated in **Figure 2**.

Concurrent to establishing the infrastructure, our user interface specialist met with the users to derive the interface standards and page layout for the application needed to support the product vision. We developed a final agreement on the proposed structure, as originally prototype in **Figures 3 and 4**.

Our team engaged from project inception and worked closely with our users to maintain an aggressive development pace, focused on end user value, clear product definition, and process transparency. As shown in **Chart 1**, our Sprint Burndown chart reflects consistent effort and continued progress over the course of the prototype period.

Likewise, our Product Backlog Item (PBI) cumulative flow, shown in **Chart 2**, reflects a continual progression of completed tasks over the entire project lifecycle.

**Retrospective**

The solicitation, as defined by GSA 18F, clearly reflected our own experiences working in customer environments: complicated external data sets, vague user requirements, short development timeframes, holiday weekends, and demanding technical challenges. While our agile experience proved useful, our DevOps infrastructure revealed itself as the true key to our prototype’s success. With so many moving parts, our team’s ability to coalesce around a working production application with every developer commit produced the most value. 
We encouraged our mock users to engage with a critical eye. They responded with both defect reports and user interface improvements. Some of those remain in our GitHub issue tracker and Trello story boards. 
We believe our approach, solution, and execution align with the 18F vision. Sevatec demonstrates our ability to both produce outcomes and provide transparency. GSA 18F can rely on Sevatec to support its customers with automated agile solutions that accelerate delivery of high-quality software solutions.
